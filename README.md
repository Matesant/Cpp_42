<h1 align="center">First Steps in Learning C++!</h1>

This repository contains the first exercises completed in C++ at Ã‰cole 42!

## About
In this project, we tackled a variety of exercises, ranging from basic to more complex challenges. These are the starting point of our journey in the final stages of our training!

### Challenges

- Namespaces: Understanding and implementing namespaces to organize code and avoid name conflicts.
- Classes: Designing and using classes to create custom data types and encapsulate functionality.
- Member Functions: Implementing member functions to define the behavior of classes and interact with class data.
- stdio Streams: Utilizing standard input and output streams for effective data handling and user interaction.
- Initialization Lists: Applying initialization lists to initialize class members efficiently and correctly.
- Static Members: Using static members to manage shared data and functionality across class instances.
- Const Members: Employing const members to ensure immutability and guarantee data integrity within classes.
- Other Basics: Exploring additional fundamental C++ concepts to build a strong foundation for more advanced topics.

## Requirements
The exercises are written in __C++ language__ and need the `c++` compiler

## Instructions

### 1. Compiling the archives

To compile the project, go to its path and run:

For __mandatory__:
```
$ make
```
### 2. Cleaning all binary (.o) and executable files (.a)

To delete all files generated with make, go to the path and run:
```
$ make fclean
```
